iOS agent to use Instana for your iOS app. The monitoring currently supports:

- Session Start
- Capture HTTP sessions automatically or manually
- Automatic delivery of device & app information (like bundle identifer, version, language, iOS device information)
- Send custom event (This can be especially helpful to send logs, to track additional performance metrics or errors.)

Optionally:
- Ignore full URLs by regex or full URLs
- Set global meta data (key/value)
- Set user specific data (like id, name and email)
- Set the current visible view to match with the HTTP sessions
